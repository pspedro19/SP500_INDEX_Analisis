# Logs Directory

Runtime logs generated by `run_pipeline.py` and other scripts are stored here.
Logging is configured via `src/config/logging_config.py`, which writes timestamped
`.log` files into this folder during execution.

The `.gitignore` file excludes `logs/*`, so log files are never committed. Only
this `README.md` and the `.gitkeep` placeholder remain in the repository,
keeping the directory present while empty in Git.
